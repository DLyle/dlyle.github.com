My name is David Lyle. I am a sophomore studying in the Tufts School of 
Engineering. I am on track to receive a Bachelor of Science in computer
science
in 2015. I grew up in Andover, Massachusetts where I attended Andover High
School and graduated at the top of my class in 2011. My interests include
playing ultimate frisbee for the Tufts Elephant Men.</p>
